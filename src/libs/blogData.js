      excessive sleepiness, while chronic sleep deprivation can contribute to
      the development or worsening of depressive symptoms. It&#39;s a cruel

  <h3 class="c7" id="h.m6qlk15ynw6m">
    <span class="c3">1. Establish a Sleep Routine</span>
  </h3>
  <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0"
      >Creating and adhering to a consistent sleep schedule can help regulate
      the body&#39;s internal clock and promote better sleep. This includes
      setting a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends or days
      off.</span

    <span class="c3">2. Practice Sleep Hygiene</span>
  </h3>

    <span class="c0"
      >Good sleep hygiene involves creating an environment conducive to
      restful sleep. This may include keeping the bedroom cool, dark, and
      quiet, avoiding screen time before bed, and engaging in relaxing
      activities like reading or taking a warm bath.</span

      relaxation, and mindfulness meditation can help calm the mind and reduce
      racing thoughts or anxiety that often disrupt sleep.</span

  <h3 class="c7" id="h.rknwj5460erf">
    <span class="c3">4. Stay Active and Get Sunlight Exposure</span>

    <span class="c0"
      >Regular physical activity and exposure to natural sunlight can help
      regulate the body&#39;s circadian rhythms and promote better sleep.

    <span class="c3">5. Seek Professional Help</span>
  </h3>
  <p class="c1">
    <span class="c0"
      >If sleep disturbances persist despite lifestyle changes, it may be
      beneficial to seek the guidance of a mental health professional.
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and, in some cases,
      medication may be recommended to help manage sleep issues and alleviate
      depressive symptoms.</span
